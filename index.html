    <h1 style="color: #0275d8; text-align: center;">Salesforce Standard Object Architecture and Relationship Model</h1>

    <p>
      Salesforce, often referred to as <a href="https://www.h2kinfosys.com/courses/salesforce-admin-certification/" 
      style="color: #0275d8; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;">Salesforce SFDC Training</a>, 
      is built on a robust and scalable data model designed to help organizations manage data efficiently. 
      Understanding the standard object architecture and relationship model is essential for anyone working 
      with Salesforce as an administrator, developer, or consultant.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #333;">Standard Object Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Salesforce organizes data into <strong>objects</strong>, which are similar to database tables. 
      Each object consists of <strong>fields</strong> (columns) and <strong>records</strong> (rows). 
      Standard objects are pre-defined by Salesforce and come with every org. Some of the most common 
      standard objects include:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Account:</strong> Represents a company or organization that a business works with.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact:</strong> Stores information about individuals associated with an Account.</li>
      <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Tracks potential sales and revenue opportunities.</li>
      <li><strong>Case:</strong> Used for managing customer support issues or service requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Lead:</strong> Captures potential prospects before they are qualified as customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These standard objects are interconnected to represent real-world business processes. Salesforce’s 
      metadata-driven architecture allows customization through custom fields, objects, and automation tools 
      without affecting the underlying database structure.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #333;">Relationship Model in Salesforce</h2>
    <p>
      The relationship model in Salesforce defines how objects are related to one another. Understanding 
      relationships helps create meaningful data connections and improves reporting and automation. 
      There are three main types of relationships in Salesforce:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Lookup Relationship:</strong> A loosely coupled relationship that links one object to another 
          for reference. For example, a Contact may have a lookup to an Account.</li>
      <li><strong>Master-Detail Relationship:</strong> A tightly bound relationship where the detail record 
          depends on the master record. If the master is deleted, the related detail records are also deleted.</li>
      <li><strong>Many-to-Many Relationship:</strong> Created using a junction object that connects two objects 
          in a bidirectional way. For instance, a “Project Assignment” junction object can relate Employees 
          and Projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These relationships ensure Salesforce data is connected, consistent, and easily accessible for 
      business intelligence, automation, and customer relationship management.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #333;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The standard object architecture and relationship model form the backbone of Salesforce’s CRM system. 
      By mastering these concepts through structured learning, such as
